    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1 - **Not possible to improve exploration**: As the learning algorithm must rely entirely on the static\n",
    "dataset $D$, there is no possibility of improving exploration: if D does not contain transitions that illustrate high-reward regions for our task it may be impossible to discover those regions. If we explore beyond our data we could have severe problems as there could be a good reason why this data is not in our dataset: maybe there is an obstacle that could damage the robot or a fragile object that could be damaged by the robot!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is opposite to online RL where you explore by interacting with the environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the collecting data phase is so important!!\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - **Distributional shift**: state-action pair distribution in $D$ does not accurately represent the distribution of states-actions of the trained policy. This challenges many existing machine learning methods, which assume that data is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). In standard supervised learning, we aim to train a model that performs well on data from the same distribution as the training data. In offline RL, our goal is to learn a policy that behaves differently (hopefully better) than what's seen in the dataset $D$. As a consequence (see later) the RL algorithms will tend to generate actions not included in $D$ and so generate **out of distribution actions data**. This could be dangerous as during inference these actions could bring the system to unexplored states (i.e. not included in $D$).\n",
    "\n",
    "ToDo: See later some example about it. It could be a 2D grid where the data was collected considering an obstacle but in inference we use the same grid without obstacles and we start from an obstacle zone??? )."

    "D4RL: It provides a set of RL evironment and suboptimal policies that generate interesting datasets that try to cover many important requirements a good offline RL algorithm should fullfil. Dataset properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 - **Narrow and biased data distributions**: e.g. from deterministic policies: Narrow datasets may arise in human demonstrations or in hand-crafted policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Excercise: combined example and see how offline is much better than offpoliy DQN\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - **Undirected and multitask data**: Undirected in the sense that is not directed towards the specific task one is trying to accomplish. E.g.: recording user interactions on the internet or recording videos of a car for autonomous driving. \n",
    "Main purpose of this property is trajectory 'stitching' (This is my combined example and see how offline is much better than offpoliy DQN), i.e. the combination of trajectories belonging to different tasks to acomplish the new task instead to find o.o.d. trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Excercise: combined example and see how offline is much better than offpoliy DQN\n",
    "\n",
    "3 - **Sparse rewards**: in an online setting this is hard as sparse rewards and exploration are highly correlated. As more sparse reward more exploration in general. So isolate the capability of the algorithm to adapt to sparse rewards is difficult when online exploration is present. In offline we only explore within the dataset so it is a good framework to study how well the algorithm react against sparse rewards -- A BIT CONFUSING --> CLARIFY\n",
    "This is important as reward shaping is a complex task in general and if overengineering could lead to solutions that exploit local optima. In contrast Designing sparse rewards is typically easier since it only requires defining the criteria for solving a task so making\n",
    "it an appealing property to address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Excercise: Use the 2D grid examples with sparce and not sparse rewards to see their performanc\n",
    "\n",
    "4 - **Suboptimal data**: Give a clear task the data could not contain any optimal trajectory so this is the realistic scenario in general\n",
