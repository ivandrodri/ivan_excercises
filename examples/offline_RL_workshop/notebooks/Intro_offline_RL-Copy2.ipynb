We want just a set of allowed state-action pairs that could be usable for the task in mind.\n",

    "dataset $D$, there is no possibility of improving exploration: if D does not contain transitions that illustrate high-reward regions for our task it may be impossible to discover those regions. If we explore beyond our data we could have severe problems as there could be a good reason why this data is not in our dataset: maybe there is an obstacle that could damage the robot or a fragile object that could be damaged by the robot!\n",

    "\n",
    "This is why the collecting data phase is so important!!\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - **Distributional shift**: state-action pair distribution in $D$ does not accurately represent the distribution of states-actions of the trained policy. This challenges many existing machine learning methods, which assume that data is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). In standard supervised learning, we aim to train a model that performs well on data from the same distribution as the training data. In offline RL, our goal is to learn a policy that behaves differently (hopefully better) than what's seen in the dataset $D$. As a consequence (see later) the RL algorithms will tend to generate actions not included in $D$ and so generate **out of distribution actions data**. This could be dangerous as during inference these actions could bring the system to unexplored states (i.e. not included in $D$).\n",

    "ToDo: See later some example about it. It could be a 2D grid where the data was collected considering an obstacle but in inference we use the same grid without obstacles and we start from an obstacle zone??? )."
