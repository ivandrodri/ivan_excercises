If we explore beyond our data we could have severe problems as there could be a good reason why this data is not in our dataset: maybe there is an obstacle that could damage the robot or a fragile object that could be damaged by the robot!\n",

    "2 - **Distributional shift**: state-action pair distribution in $D$ does not accurately represent the distribution of states-actions of the trained policy. This challenges many existing machine learning methods, which assume that data is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). In standard supervised learning, we aim to train a model that performs well on data from the same distribution as the training data. In offline RL, our goal is to learn a policy that behaves differently (hopefully better) than what's seen in the dataset $D$. As a consequence (see later) the RL algorithms will tend to generate actions not included in $D$ and so generate **out of distribution actions data**. This could be dangerous as during inference these actions could bring the system to unexplored states (i.e. not included in $D$).\n",
